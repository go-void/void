# void

Void is a DNS level adblocker written in Go. It uses [Portal](https://github.com/go-void/portal) as a DNS server.

## Status

Void is under active development and at the current stage not yet usable. Portal on the other hand is and can be used as
a standalone DNS server, which currently supports the most common DNS RFCs (see 
[here](https://github.com/go-void/portal#supported-rfcs) for more information).
